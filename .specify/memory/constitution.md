# Image Generator Constitution

## Core Principles

### User-Centric Simplicity
We build modern web apps to serve end users and bring simplicity to their experience. All features and functionality must prioritize user needs and maintain a clean, intuitive interface that eliminates unnecessary complexity.

### Domain UX-First
For web apps we use domain UX principles, ensuring interface decisions are driven by user context and specific domain requirements rather than technical implementation details.

### TDD Applied Strategically
We follow test-driven development for business logic and core functionality, with non-negotiable test coverage for critical paths. However, for UI layer development, we use domain UX principles so no test-driven development is required for UI layer components where rapid iteration and visual feedback are more valuable.

### Apple Design Principles
We follow Apple-like design principles and best practices to build modern web platforms, emphasizing clean aesthetics, intuitive interactions, and high-quality user experience.

### Modern Web Platform Standards
We build modern web platforms using current web standards and technologies that ensure performance, accessibility, and cross-browser compatibility.

### User Experience Focus
Our primary focus is on delivering exceptional user experience through thoughtful design, intuitive interactions, and seamless functionality that adds real value to users' lives.

## Technology Stack Requirements

We utilize modern web technologies including React, TypeScript, and CSS-in-JS solutions to ensure maintainable, scalable, and performant applications.

## Development Workflow

Our development workflow emphasizes rapid iteration on UI components while maintaining rigorous testing standards for business logic. Code reviews must verify compliance with design principles and user experience standards.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. All PRs and code reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Amendments require documentation of reasoning and approval from core team members.
