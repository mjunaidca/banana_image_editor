# Research: Build Image Video Editor

## Decision: Tech Stack Selection
**Rationale**: Selected Next.js 15 with TypeScript for modern React framework with excellent TypeScript support, server-side rendering capabilities, and a strong ecosystem. This aligns with the constitutional requirements for modern web platform standards.

## Decision: Styling Solution
**Rationale**: Chose TailwindCSS with shadcn/ui components for rapid development of clean, accessible UIs that align with the constitutional principles of Apple Design Principles and User Experience Focus.

## Decision: AI Integration
**Rationale**: Selected Vercel AI SDK with Google Gemini API for processing images and prompts. This provides a clean, well-documented integration path that supports the required multimodal functionality.

## Decision: Package Manager
**Rationale**: Using pnpm as requested for faster, more efficient dependency management with better disk space utilization.

## Decision: Project Structure
**Rationale**: Using Next.js App Router structure with a single page application as specified in requirements. This maintains simplicity and aligns with User-Centric Simplicity principle.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative Tech Stacks:
1. **Next.js with JavaScript vs TypeScript**: TypeScript was chosen for better maintainability and reduced runtime errors, despite slightly higher initial learning curve.
2. **Other frameworks (React + Vite, Remix, etc.)**: Next.js was chosen for its built-in optimizations, SSR capabilities, and strong ecosystem.
3. **Other styling solutions (Styled-components, Emotion, vanilla CSS)**: TailwindCSS was chosen for rapid development and consistency with modern React development practices.

### Alternative AI SDKs:
1. **Direct Google Gemini API vs Vercel AI SDK**: Vercel AI SDK was chosen for better integration with Next.js applications, streaming capabilities, and additional safety features.
2. **Other AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)**: Google Gemini was chosen as specifically requested in the feature requirements.

### Alternative Project Structures:
1. **Multi-page application vs Single page**: Single page was chosen as specified in requirements to keep the application simple.
2. **Backend API vs Client-side processing**: Client-side processing was chosen as specified in requirements to avoid complex backend infrastructure.
