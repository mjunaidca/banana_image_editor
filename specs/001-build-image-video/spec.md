# Feature Specification: Image Video Editor

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-image-video`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build-image-video-editor We will build an image video editor where user can provide images and a prompt and get an image edited output. We will use the latest gemini nano model for this."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user uploads an image and provides a text prompt. The system processes the image and prompt using an LLM and returns an updated or refined prompt based on the input image and original prompt.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has selected an image to process, **When** they enter a text prompt and submit the request, **Then** the system returns an updated prompt based on the input image and original prompt
2. **Given** a user has uploaded an image and a prompt, **When** the processing begins, **Then** the system provides feedback on the processing status and estimated time
3. **Given** a user receives an updated prompt, **When** they are satisfied with the result, **Then** they can copy or download the returned prompt

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the uploaded image format is not supported? (System returns error message)
- How does system handle very large image files that exceed processing limits? (System returns error message)
- What if the user's prompt is unclear or ambiguous? (System returns error message)
- How does the system handle requests when the AI model is temporarily unavailable? (System returns error message)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to upload images in common formats (JPG, PNG)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a text input field for users to enter image editing prompts
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to submit image and prompt for LLM processing
- **FR-004**: System MUST process the image and prompt using an LLM
- **FR-005**: System MUST return an updated prompt to the user after processing is complete
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide feedback to the user about processing status and time remaining
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to download or copy the returned prompt
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate uploaded image formats and reject files larger than 5MB

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: The person using the image video editor, responsible for uploading images and providing prompts
- **Original Image**: The unedited image uploaded by the user for processing
- **Input Prompt**: The text provided by the user to be processed with the image
- **Output Prompt**: The updated or refined prompt returned by the LLM after processing

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03
- Q: What image formats should the system support for upload? ‚Üí A: JPG and PNG only (basic support)
- Q: What is the maximum file size limit for image uploads? ‚Üí A: 5MB (lightweight processing)
- Q: How should the system handle processing failures? ‚Üí A: Just tell user the reason - keep it simple
- Q: What level of image editing precision should be expected? ‚Üí A: We just give llm image + prompt and get back prompt
- Q: Should users be able to save multiple versions of edited images? ‚Üí A: Please continue
